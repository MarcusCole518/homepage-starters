1. **Create an empty [Kontent.ai project](https://kontent.ai/learn/tutorials/manage-kontent/projects/manage-projects/#a-create-projects)**

2. **Run the Kontent.ai setup script.**

   > If you've decided to use a non-empty project, keep in mind that there might occur errors during import. Therefore it is better to use an empty project. The script provides you with an option to clear your project before importing.

   From your site's root directory, run:

   ```sh
   cd my-homepage
   yarn setup
   ```

   This will run a script to populate your Kontent.ai project with demo content.
